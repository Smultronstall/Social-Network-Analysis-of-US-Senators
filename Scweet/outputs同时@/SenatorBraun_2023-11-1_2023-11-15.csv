 I see you had time for a trip to the border to find more ways to be racist! Now it‚Äôs time to call for a ceasefire in Gaza to stop genocide!! 

Please do something useful with your time, like preventing death instead of blaming brown for non-existent problems.",üåà ü§ó,,,,[],https://twitter.com/t_wreck5/status/1724444896289841536
