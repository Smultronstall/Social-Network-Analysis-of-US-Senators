Nov 5","1.  I was struck by both the substance of the comments — Senator [Daniel] Sullivan (R-Alaska) talking about the impact on readiness undermining the U.S. military — but I was also struck by the tone of the comments. That they waited nine months to confront this unserious, reckless",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/SharonSlominski/status/1720904741260079407

Nov 5","I bet Daniels got concussed.   Brian Kelly is just the type of guy to put a player in harm's way for his own benefit.

Remember Declan Sullivan?
